# Claude Context for Zoho-Discord Integration

## Project Overview
Advanced Zoho Mail to Discord integration with full bidirectional email management through interactive Discord buttons.

## Current State - BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED! 🎉
- **Interactive buttons working**: Mark as Read and Reply buttons appear and respond in Discord
- **Rich embeds**: Beautiful email display with proper formatting
- **Discord bot**: Sending messages directly with interactive components
- **From address management**: 12+ email addresses loaded with smart defaults
- **One remaining issue**: Mark as read shows in Discord but not syncing to Zoho

## Key Files
- `index.js` - Complete Discord bot + Express server with interactive buttons
- `ZOHO_PAYLOAD_REFERENCE.md` - Complete webhook payload structure
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive status and debugging info
- `TODO.md` - Updated task tracking
- `get-account-id.js` - Helper script for Zoho account ID

## Environment Setup - PRODUCTION READY
- **Deployed on Coolify**: `http://uko848o4k8ss4o8o8k0gsoss.178.156.163.130.sslip.io`
- **Discord bot online**: Full permissions, channel ID configured
- **Zoho OAuth working**: Access tokens, account ID, 12+ from addresses
- **SQLite database**: Message mappings and from address storage

## Technical Architecture COMPLETED
```
Zoho Email → Webhook → Discord Bot (rich embeds + buttons) → User Clicks → Zoho API
                ↓                                                    ↓
            SQLite Database ←---- Message Mapping ----→ Email Actions
```

## Environment Variables
```
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=1395867738534187178 ✅
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=working ✅
ZOHO_ACCOUNT_ID=401862000000008002 ✅
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=working ✅
All other vars configured ✅
```

## Major Technical Breakthroughs Achieved

### 1. Discord Bot Permissions Issue - SOLVED
- **Problem**: 403 errors when bot tried to access webhook info
- **Solution**: Added DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID env var, bot sends directly to channel
- **Result**: Perfect interactive buttons with no permission issues

### 2. Dynamic From Address Selection - IMPLEMENTED
- **Features**: 12+ email addresses with display names
- **Smart defaults**: Domain matching for intelligent reply suggestions
- **Daily refresh**: Automatic sync of from addresses every 24 hours

### 3. Interactive Discord UI - FULLY WORKING
- **Rich embeds**: Beautiful email display with proper fields
- **Action buttons**: Mark as Read ✅ and Reply 💬
- **Visual feedback**: Spinner → Green message when marked as read
- **Reply system**: Modal with from address dropdown (not yet tested)

## Current Issue - Final Debug Needed
**Mark as Read functionality:**
- ✅ Discord UI works perfectly (button → spinner → green)
- ⚠️ Zoho API call **INTERMITTENT** - works sometimes, not always
- **Pattern**: Inconsistent success rate - sometimes marks as read, sometimes doesn't
- **Next step**: Add debug logging to identify when/why it fails (timing? race condition?)

## API Details
- **Mark as Read**: `PUT /accounts/401862000000008002/updatemessage`
- **Payload**: `{"mode": "markAsRead", "messageId": [messageId]}`
- **Auth**: Working OAuth with `ZohoMail.messages.ALL` scope

## Next Session Priority
1. **Debug mark as read** - Add logging to see Zoho API response
2. **Test reply functionality** - Full reply flow with from address selection
3. **Final testing** - Complete end-to-end workflow validation

This project is 95% complete with just final API debugging needed! 🚀
