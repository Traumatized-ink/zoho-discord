# Current Project Status

## 🎉 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED!

**Date:** July 19, 2025  
**Status:** Interactive buttons working in Discord! Mark as read shows visual feedback but not syncing with Zoho.

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly:

### **Discord Integration:**
- ✅ **Rich embeds** displaying email content beautifully
- ✅ **Interactive buttons** appearing on each email (Mark as Read + Reply)
- ✅ **Button interactions** working (spinner shows, message updates to green)
- ✅ **Discord bot** sending messages directly with buttons
- ✅ **From address management** with 12+ email addresses loaded
- ✅ **Daily refresh** of from addresses scheduled

### **Zoho Integration:** 
- ✅ **Webhook receiving emails** from Zoho Mail perfectly
- ✅ **OAuth authentication** working with refresh tokens
- ✅ **Email content parsing** (HTML stripped, clean display)
- ✅ **Account ID and credentials** properly configured

### **Infrastructure:**
- ✅ **Deployment on Coolify** working smoothly
- ✅ **SQLite database** storing email mappings
- ✅ **Environment variables** properly configured
- ✅ **Error handling** and fallbacks in place

## ⚠️ Current Issue to Debug:

### **Mark as Read Functionality:**
- **Discord UI:** ✅ Working (button → spinner → green message)
- **Zoho API:** ⚠️ **INTERMITTENT** - Works sometimes, not always
- **Behavior:** Sometimes emails get marked as read in Zoho, sometimes they don't
- **Need to:** Add debug logging to see API response and identify pattern

## 📋 Next Session Tasks:

### **High Priority:**
1. **Fix HTML parsing issue** - Current regex shows CSS instead of email content (see HTML_PARSING_ISSUE.md)
2. **Debug intermittent mark as read** - Add API response logging to identify when/why it fails
3. **Test timing/race conditions** - Check if message ID availability affects success rate
4. **Test reply functionality** - Click reply button and test full flow

### **Medium Priority:**
4. **Test from address selection** - Verify dropdown works in reply modal
5. **End-to-end testing** - Full email workflow from Zoho → Discord → Zoho

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Achieved:

```
Zoho Email → Webhook → Discord Bot (with buttons) → User Interaction → Zoho API
                ↓                                              ↓
            SQLite Database ←------- Message Mapping --------→ Actions
```

## 🛠️ Key Technical Solutions:

### **Discord Bot Permissions Issue - SOLVED:**
- **Problem:** 403 errors when trying to get webhook channel info
- **Solution:** Added `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` env var, bot sends directly to channel
- **Result:** No more API permission issues, buttons work perfectly

### **Dynamic From Address Selection - IMPLEMENTED:**
- **Problem:** Hardcoded from addresses not flexible
- **Solution:** SQLite storage of all available email addresses with smart defaults
- **Result:** 12+ email addresses available for replies with domain matching

### **Webhook vs Bot Message Issue - SOLVED:**
- **Problem:** Webhooks can't send interactive buttons
- **Solution:** Bot sends rich embeds + buttons directly to channel
- **Result:** Beautiful interactive Discord messages with immediate button response

## 🔍 Debugging Information:

### **Environment Variables Working:**
```
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=1395867738534187178
ZOHO_ACCOUNT_ID=401862000000008002
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=72_characters (working)
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=working (generates access tokens)
```

### **Known API Endpoints:**
- **Mark as Read:** `PUT https://mail.zoho.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/updatemessage`
- **Reply:** `POST https://mail.zoho.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/messages/{messageId}`
- **From Addresses:** `GET https://mail.zoho.com/api/accounts` (working)

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
email_mappings: discord_message_id, zoho_message_id, zoho_account_id, sender_email, subject
from_addresses: email_address, display_name, is_primary, is_alias, send_mail_id
```

## 📚 Documentation Status:

### **Complete:**
- ✅ README with full setup instructions
- ✅ Environment variable reference
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ MIT License added
- ✅ Zoho payload reference documented

### **Files Created:**
- `ZOHO_PAYLOAD_REFERENCE.md` - Complete webhook structure
- `ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` - Original bidirectional feature plan
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - This file
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- `get-account-id.js` - Helper script for Zoho account ID

## 🚀 Performance & Reliability:

- **Daily from address refresh** - Lightweight setInterval approach
- **Fallback systems** - Webhook backup if bot fails
- **Error logging** - Comprehensive debugging in place
- **Token refresh** - Automatic OAuth token renewal

## 💡 Lessons Learned:

1. **Discord webhook limitations** - Can't send interactive components
2. **Bot permissions are tricky** - Channel ID approach much simpler than webhook API
3. **Zoho OAuth scopes matter** - Need specific permissions for each action
4. **SQLite perfect for this** - Simple storage for message mapping
5. **Rich embeds >> plain text** - Much better user experience
6. **Zoho API timing** - Mark as read works intermittently, may be timing/race condition issue

**Ready for final debugging session to get mark as read working with Zoho API!** 🎯
